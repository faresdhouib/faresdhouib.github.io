        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Fares, a 20-year-old graphic designer from Tunisia with a passion for creating standout brand identities. With over four years of experience under my belt, I’ve had the opportunity to work on diverse projects, each one helping me refine my skills and deepen my understanding of design.</p>
        <p>I’m thrilled to be taking the next step in my journey by studying Business Administration. For me, graphic design is more than just an artistic pursuit; it’s a business in itself. I believe that behind every successful project is a well-thought-out strategy and a clear vision.</p>
        <p>By merging my design expertise with business acumen, I aim to create not only visually compelling work but also effective, strategic solutions that drive success. I’m excited to continue pushing the boundaries and bringing ideas to life.</p>
        <p>Feel free to explore my portfolio and reach out if you’d like to collaborate!</p>
