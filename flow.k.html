            <h1>Flow.K</h1>
            <p><strong>Brief:</strong> Flow.K is a dynamic and youthful brand looking to make an impact. The logo needed to capture the essence of flow, movement, and energy.</p>
            <p><strong>Challenges:</strong> The challenge was to convey a sense of movement in a static logo while maintaining clarity and legibility.</p>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> I used fluid lines and a vibrant color palette to express the brandâ€™s energetic vibe, creating a logo that stands out and resonates with the target audience.</p>
