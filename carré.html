            <h1>Carré</h1>
            <p><strong>Brief:</strong> Carré is a French architecture company. The logo design focuses on a square shape, representing both the word 'carré' (which means square in French) and an architect's perspective of a building.</p>
            <p><strong>Challenges:</strong> The main challenge was to create a logo that was both simple and versatile, able to represent the company’s architectural philosophy while being easily recognizable in different sizes and applications.</p>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> The final design incorporated clean lines and geometric forms to create a modern and professional look that aligns with the company’s identity.</p>
