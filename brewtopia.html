            <p><strong>Brief:</strong> Brewtopia is a coffee shop brand that aims to create a warm and inviting atmosphere for its customers. The brand identity needed to reflect the cozy, artisanal vibe of the shop.</p>
            <p><strong>Challenges:</strong> The main challenge was to design a logo that could communicate both the high-quality nature of the coffee and the relaxed ambiance of the shop.</p>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> The final logo design used earthy tones and hand-drawn elements to evoke a sense of craftsmanship and comfort, perfectly capturing the essence of Brewtopia.</p>
